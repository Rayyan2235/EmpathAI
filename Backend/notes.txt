main.py (FastAPI Functionality):
    Start the fastAPI server and load it 
    
    Need to allow frontend to access the backend using cors.middleware

    Need to let the backend know what kind of request is gonna come up from the frontend

    call for tokenRequest (So when the frontend accesses the backend using the cors.middleware, it calls this func to get token from the token_gen function)

    Initially, the frontend will reach to the main.py file and will then be directed to the token_gen file with the room_id and user_id of the user and ask to return a token in json format

Token_gen:
    Load env file
    get the Livekit key using os
    using the userid and roomid, generate a token
    
    return the token

Frontend:

    Needs to fetch the fastAPI backend for the livekit tokens
