Building relationships and making connections can lead to new opportunities and insights.\n4. **Focus on your strengths and passions**: Remember what drew you to computer science in the first place? What are your greatest strengths and interests? Focus on developing those skills and exploring areas that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Don't forget to prioritize your physical and mental well-being during this challenging time. Make sure to get enough sleep, exercise regularly, and engage in activities that help you relax and reduce stress.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel uncertain or unsure about the future.
